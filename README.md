# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing-using-SQL-and-Streamlit

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a Streamlit application to harvest and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The application allows users to input YouTube channel IDs, retrieve detailed channel and video data using the YouTube API, store the data in a SQL database, and run queries to analyze and visualize the data.

## Key Features
* Data Extraction: Fetch detailed statistics from YouTube channels including channel name, subscribers, video count, and more.
* Video and Comment Data: Extract information on videos and comments, including likes, views, and comment text.
* Data Storage: Store the extracted data in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
* Query Execution: Run predefined SQL queries to get insights into the data, such as top videos, most commented videos, and more.
* Streamlit Interface: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for data input, extraction, and visualization.
